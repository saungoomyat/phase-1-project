McDonald's Calory Finder

I am into fitness and eating healthy. However, there is always that craving or urge to eat fast food. My usual go to is McDonald's. 
Therefore, I decided to make a web page that allows me to filter out what to veat based on the calories of the food item.

The web page consists of a search bar at the top. 
Key in the calories you want and the list will match the menu item with the same calories.

One thing about these fast food franchises is that they are always changing their menus.
Thus, I have added an add and delete funciton to the web page.
Simply key in the information required and add to the menu. 
You can also just hit the delete buttonm to remove an old menu item.
